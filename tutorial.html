                        hours or more and 30 days or less among patients with electrocardiograms collected through the
                        patient monitoring in the intensive care unit.
                    </li>
                    <li>Drugs used in 3% or more of the patient group are extracted and fluid-based drugs are excluded
                        from analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>Among the above drugs, drugs that have already been identified for cardiovascular risk are
                        selected as matching drugs, and drugs that have not been identified are selected for analysis.

                    <li>Inquiry about QT prolongation through ECG data for 12 hours after the first administration time
                        for each drug to be analyzed. However, QT prolongation is excluded at the time of the first
                        administration.
                    </li>
                    <li>To match the period from ICU admission to the time of drug use, the patient's record is divided
                        into 12 hours, and the time point closest to the first administration time in the exposure group
                        is matched to set the observation reference point in the non-exposure group.
                    </li>
                    <li>Propensity score matching for the most recent measured lab value among the target drug,
                        diagnosis prior to the first administration time, and 7 days after the first administration
                        time.

                    <li>Derivation of hazard ratio and significance for the occurrence of QT prolongation between
                        exposed and non-exposed groups for each drug through Cox regression analysis.
